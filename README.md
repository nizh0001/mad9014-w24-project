This single-page application, combines the power of the Pixabay API for image search and the MediaPipe API for face detection. Users can seamlessly search, display, save, and delete images while also utilizing advanced face detection capabilities.

## How to Use:

- Search Page: Navigate to the Search Page in the application.
- Enter Keywords: Enter keywords related to the images you want to search for.
- Browse Results: Browse through the search results and select images you wish to save.
- Save Images: Save selected images for future reference.
- View Saved Images: Access saved images from the application's interface.
- Delete Images: Delete saved images when they are no longer needed.
- Face Detection: Use the integrated MediaPipe API to detect faces on saved images, with confidence percentages displayed.

## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them:

- API Integration: Integrating the Pixabay API for image search and the MediaPipe API for face detection required careful planning and implementation. Overcoming this challenge involved thorough understanding of each API's documentation and finding efficient ways to integrate them.

- Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to handle API errors and unexpected user inputs was crucial. I addressed this challenge by implementing error-catching mechanisms and providing informative error messages to users.

- Performance Optimization: Ensuring optimal performance, especially when dealing with large datasets of images, required careful optimization of code and resource management. I tackled this challenge by implementing efficient algorithms and caching mechanisms.
