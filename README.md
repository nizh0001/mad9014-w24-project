# Final Project

This single-page application, combines the power of the Pixabay API for image search and the MediaPipe API for face detection. Users can seamlessly search, display, save, and delete images while also utilizing advanced face detection capabilities.

## Features:

- Image Search: Utilize the Pixabay API to search for images based on specific keywords.
- Image Display: View search results and saved images in a visually appealing format.
- Save and Delete: Save images for future reference and delete them when no longer needed.
- Face Detection: Utilize the MediaPipe API for face detection on saved images, displaying the percentage of confidence for each detected face.

## How to Use:

- Search Page: Navigate to the Search Page in the application.
- Enter Keywords: Enter keywords related to the images you want to search for.
- Browse Results: Browse through the search results and select images you wish to save.
- Save Images: Save selected images for future reference.
- View Saved Images: Access saved images from the application's interface.
- Delete Images: Delete saved images when they are no longer needed.
- Face Detection: Use the integrated MediaPipe API to detect faces on saved images, with confidence percentages displayed.

## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them:

- API Integration: Integrating the Pixabay API for image search and the MediaPipe API for face detection required careful planning and implementation. Overcoming this challenge involved thorough understanding of each API's documentation and finding efficient ways to integrate them.

- MediaPipe Integration: Integrating the MediaPipe API for face detection presented technical challenges due to its complex functionality. Overcoming this involved studying the MediaPipe documentation, experimenting with sample code, and seeking assistance from online communities when needed.

- Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to handle API errors and unexpected user inputs was crucial. I addressed this challenge by implementing error-catching mechanisms and providing informative error messages to users.

- Performance Optimization: Ensuring optimal performance, especially when dealing with large datasets of images, required careful optimization of code and resource management. I tackled this challenge by implementing efficient algorithms and caching mechanisms.
